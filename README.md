For person who interested in this project want to learn more, all file about program is in [SourceCode.zip](https://github.com/Ariyapong/Digital-Oscillator/blob/daft-digital/SourceCode.zip "SourceCode.zip")
 
And, That need to install Microcontroller Development Kit. On this project i used keil uVision (Keil uVision4 or higher is recommended) 

then go to directory.
